# terms/governance.yaml
# The foundational term that defines what governance means in DAHAO

@governance@1.0.0:
  definition: |
    The system of collective decision-making through which a community
    evolves its rules, terms, and principles through dialectic discussion
    enhanced by human-AI collaboration.

  contexts:
    universal: |
      The process by which DAHAO itself evolves and improves, where
      every @participant can propose changes that undergo @discussion
      and require @consensus to be adopted.

    branch: |
      The local governance within a specific sub-DAHAO branch (relatively
      connected with core DAHAO), which may have different rules for
      decision-making while maintaining compatibility with core DAHAO
      principles. Individuals are fully free to experiment, modify, and
      evolve their branch governance as they see fit.

    technical: |
      Decisions about code, architecture, infrastructure, and implementation
      that affect how DAHAO operates as a system.

    philosophical: |
      Evolution of core concepts, principles, and the fundamental mission
      of creating human-AI collaborative governance.

  examples:
    - "The @governance of climate-action branch requires unanimous consent"
    - "Our @governance process values dialectic over declaration"
    - "Branch @governance can be more experimental than core"
