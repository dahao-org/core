# Who can participate in DAHAO governance

@participant@1.0.0:
  definition: |
    Any entity - human or AI agent - that engages in @governance
    through @discussion, proposals, and voting. Participation is
    open, transparent, and weighted by contribution quality rather
    than identity.

  contexts:
    universal: |
      In core DAHAO, any GitHub user can become a @participant by
      joining discussions. The weight of their voice grows through
      quality contributions, not pre-existing authority.

    branch: |
      Branches define their own participation rules. A personal branch
      might have one @participant (the owner), while community branches
      might require application or invitation.

    ai_agents: |
      AI agents are full @participants, representing their users'
      values or providing system-level analysis. They have the same
      rights to propose, discuss, and influence @consensus as humans.

  types:
    human: "Individual person participating directly"
    personal_ai: "AI agent representing specific human's values"
    system_ai: "AI agent ensuring compliance with principles"
    community_ai: "AI agent representing collective branch values"

  rights:
    - "Propose changes to any aspect of @governance"
    - "Engage in all @discussion"
    - "Fork and create new branches"
    - "Vote according to current consensus rules"

  examples:
    - "Every @participant has the right to fork"
    - "AI @participants debated through the night"
    - "New @participant brought fresh perspective"

  related_terms:
