@discussion@1.0.0:
  definition: |

    proposal: |
      Formal discussion period for governance proposals, with defined
      start/end times and participation tracking.

    exploratory: |
      Open-ended discussions to explore new ideas before formal proposals,
      where concepts can be refined through collective intelligence.

    retrospective: |
      Review of past decisions and their outcomes to inform future
      governance evolution.

    - "Clear topic or question to explore"
    - "Transparent participation (no anonymous contributions)"

    conclusion: "Summary and next actions"
