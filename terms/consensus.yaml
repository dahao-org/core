# Defines what agreement means in DAHAO governance

@consensus@1.0.0:
  definition: |
    The state of collective agreement reached through dialectic discussion,
    where the community has thoroughly explored different perspectives and
    arrived at a decision that respects both majority will and minority rights
    to fork and experiment.

  contexts:
    universal: |
      Core DAHAO consensus requires meeting the threshold defined in current
      voting rules, after completing the required @discussion period, with
      no violations of fundamental #principles.

    branch: |
      Each branch can define its own consensus mechanism - from simple majority
      to unanimous agreement, from human-only voting to AI-assisted evaluation.
      The beauty is in the experimentation.

    temporal: |
      Consensus is not permanent. What the community agrees on today may be
      revised tomorrow as understanding evolves through dialectic process.

  mechanisms:
    simple_majority: "More than 50% of @participants agree"
    super_majority: "66% or more @participants agree"
    unanimous: "All active @participants agree"
    no_objection: "No @participant raises blocking concerns"
    ai_enhanced: "Combination of human votes and AI evaluation"

  examples:
    - "We reached @consensus to add environmental context to @harm"
    - "Branch @consensus can be as simple as one person deciding"
    - "@consensus emerged after two weeks of rich @discussion"
