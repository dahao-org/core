# principles/transparency.yaml
# All governance must be visible and verifiable

#transparency:
  statement: |
    Every aspect of @governance must be public, traceable, and
    verifiable. From @discussion to decision, from proposal to
    implementation, nothing happens in darkness. Transparency
    is not just about openness but about building trust through
    radical visibility.

  rationale: |
    Trust emerges from transparency. When every @participant can see
    how decisions are made, verify the process was followed, and trace
    the history of changes, the system gains legitimacy through
    openness rather than authority.

  requirements:
    - "All @discussion happens in public forums"
    - "Every version change is tracked and attributed"
    - "AI agent actions are logged and auditable"
    - "Voting records are public"
    - "Fork and branch relationships visible"

  exceptions:
    - "Personal data privacy protected"
    - "Security vulnerabilities disclosed responsibly"
    - "But even exceptions must be transparently defined"

  examples:
    - "Every @consensus includes link to full discussion"
    - "AI voting rationales published automatically"
    - "Branch experiments visible to inspire others"
