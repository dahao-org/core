# principles/fork-freedom.yaml
# The right to experiment must be absolute

#fork-freedom:
  statement: |
    Every @participant has the inalienable right to fork and create
    their own governance experiments. When @consensus cannot be reached,
    or when minorities need to explore different paths, forking enables
    peaceful divergence without forcing compromise that satisfies no one.

  rationale: |
    Innovation requires experimentation. By guaranteeing the right to
    fork, DAHAO ensures that @governance evolution never stagnates due
    to majoritarian blocking. The best ideas can be proven in branches
    before being adopted by core.

  guarantees:
    - "Forking requires no permission"
    - "Full history and attribution preserved"
    - "Branches can propose improvements upstream"
    - "Successful innovations can merge back"
    - "Parallel experiments enrich the ecosystem"

  balance:
    - "Forking is not fragmentation but experimentation"
    - "Network effects encourage compatibility"
    - "Shared principles connect diverse branches"

  examples:
    - "Animal welfare fork pioneered new @harm definitions"
    - "Personal branches test radical governance"
    - "Failed experiments harm only the branch"
