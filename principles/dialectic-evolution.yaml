# Truth emerges through discussion, not declaration

#dialectic-evolution:
  statement: |
    Understanding emerges through the dialectic process of thesis,
    antithesis, and synthesis. No single @participant, whether human
    or AI, possesses complete truth. Only through @discussion that
    genuinely engages with opposing views can wisdom emerge.

  rationale: |
    The history of human knowledge shows that progress comes from
    challenging assumptions, not protecting them. By requiring all
    @governance changes to undergo dialectic examination, DAHAO
    ensures decisions are tested by opposition before adoption.

  process:
    thesis: "Initial proposal or current state"
    antithesis: "Challenges, concerns, alternatives"
    synthesis: "New understanding incorporating both"
    evolution: "Synthesis becomes new thesis"

  requirements:
    - "Every proposal must allow counter-arguments"
    - "Good faith engagement with opposition"
    - "Time for antithesis to fully develop"
    - "Synthesis must address raised concerns"

  examples:
    - "@harm definition evolved through environmental critique"
    - "AI speed concerns led to human oversight synthesis"
    - "Fork freedom emerged from centralization thesis"
