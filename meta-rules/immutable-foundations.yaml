# The unchangeable bedrock of DAHAO

title: "Meta-Rule: Immutable Foundations"

preamble: |
  While DAHAO embraces change and evolution, certain foundational
  elements must remain constant to preserve its essential nature.
  These immutable foundations cannot be changed, only abandoned by
  forking to create something new.

immutable_foundations:
  1_fork_freedom: |
    The right to fork and create new governance experiments is absolute
    and inalienable. No rule, vote, or consensus can remove this right.
    This ensures peaceful exit and continuous innovation.

  2_transparency: |
    All governance must be public and auditable. While implementation
    details may vary, the principle of radical transparency cannot be
    made optional or restricted.

  3_versioning: |
    All changes must be versioned and history must be preserved. The
    ability to see how governance evolved and to rollback changes is
    fundamental to trust and learning.

  4_no_eternal_rules: |
    Except for these immutable foundations, no rule can be made
    permanently unchangeable. The system must always be able to
    evolve beyond its current state.

rationale: |
  These foundations are not arbitrary restrictions but necessary
  conditions for DAHAO to function as intended. Without fork freedom,
  it becomes tyranny. Without transparency, it becomes conspiracy.
  Without versioning, it becomes revisionism. Without change capacity,
  it becomes dogma.

enforcement: |
  These foundations are enforced by:
  - The community's commitment to the vision
  - The technical architecture (Git's immutable history)
  - The right to fork if violated
  - AI agents trained to detect violations

paradox_resolution: |
  "But can this rule change itself?" No. These foundations can only
  be abandoned by creating a new system. DAHAO with different
  foundations would not be DAHAO but something else. Fork freely
  to explore alternatives.
