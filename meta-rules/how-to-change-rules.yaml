# The process for evolving governance itself

title: "Governance Evolution Meta-Rule"

description: |
  How DAHAO governance can change over time. This meta-rule defines
  the process for modifying rules, terms, principles, and even other
  meta-rules, ensuring governance can evolve while maintaining stability.

categories:
  terms:
    process: "Standard proposal process"
    discussion_period: "7 days minimum"
    consensus_threshold: "60%"
    versioning: "Semantic versioning required"
    breaking_changes: "Require major version bump"

  rules:
    process: "Enhanced proposal process"
    discussion_period: "14 days minimum"
    consensus_threshold: "66%"
    testing: "Must be tested in branch for 30 days"
    rollback: "Previous version active for 7 days after change"

  principles:
    process: "Extraordinary proposal process"
    discussion_period: "30 days minimum"
    consensus_threshold: "75%"
    branch_testing: "Multiple branches must validate"
    cooling_period: "7 days between discussion and vote"

  meta_rules:
    process: "Constitutional amendment process"
    discussion_period: "45 days minimum"
    consensus_threshold: "80%"
    ratification: "Requires branch ratification"
    implementation_delay: "30 days after approval"

change_workflow:
  1_proposal:
    - "Create [Proposal] discussion with clear diff"
    - "Specify which category is being changed"
    - "Provide rationale and impact analysis"

  2_discussion:
    - "Mandatory discussion period based on category"
    - "AI agents analyze for unintended consequences"
    - "Alternative proposals can be submitted"

  3_testing:
    - "Branch implementation for validation"
    - "Gather metrics on impact"
    - "Document any issues discovered"

  4_decision:
    - "Check consensus threshold met"
    - "Verify process was followed"
    - "Create implementation PR if approved"

  5_implementation:
    - "Apply versioning rules"
    - "Update all references"
    - "Notify all branches of changes"

immutable_aspects:
  - "The right to fork (#fork-freedom)"
  - "Versioning requirement for terms"
  - "Transparency of all governance"
  - "This meta-rule modification process"
