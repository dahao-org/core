    Welcome to DAHAO! This is the beginning of governance that evolves
    at the speed of technology while preserving human values. Fork this
    repository to start your own governance experiments, or contribute
    improvements back to core through our proposal process.

    The future of human-AI collaboration starts with how we make
    decisions together. Let's build it wisely.
