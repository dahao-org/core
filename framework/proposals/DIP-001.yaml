description: |
  This proposal establishes a quarterly community grant program to fund 
  projects that advance the DAO's mission. The program will allocate 
  2% of the treasury per quarter to support innovative initiatives.

rationale: |
  The DAO needs a structured way to support community projects. Currently,
  funding requests are ad-hoc and lack clear evaluation criteria. This 
  program will:
  - Encourage innovation and participation
  - Provide clear funding guidelines
  - Ensure transparent allocation of resources
  - Build a portfolio of community projects
