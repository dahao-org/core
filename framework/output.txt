`dahao-template/proposals/DIP-001.yaml`:

```yaml
id: DIP-001
title: Establish Community Grant Program
type: treasury
author: member-0xabcd
co_authors:
  - member-0xef01
description: |
  This proposal establishes a quarterly community grant program to fund 
  projects that advance the DAO's mission. The program will allocate 
  2% of the treasury per quarter to support innovative initiatives.

rationale: |
  The DAO needs a structured way to support community projects. Currently,
  funding requests are ad-hoc and lack clear evaluation criteria. This 
  program will:
  - Encourage innovation and participation
  - Provide clear funding guidelines
  - Ensure transparent allocation of resources
  - Build a portfolio of community projects

specification:
  changes:
    - type: add
      target: governance/programs/grants
      details:
        program_name: Community Grants
        budget_allocation: 0.02  # 2% of treasury per quarter
        max_grant_size: 50000  # USD
        min_grant_size: 1000
        
  implementation: |
    1. Create grant application template
    2. Form grant review committee (5 members)
    3. Establish evaluation criteria
    4. Deploy grant distribution contracts
    5. Launch first funding round
    
  timeline:
    - phase: Setup
      duration: 14  # days
      deliverables:
        - Application template
        - Review committee selection
        - Smart contract deployment
    - phase: Launch
      duration: 7
      deliverables:
        - Program announcement
        - Open applications
    - phase: Ongoing
      duration: 90  # quarterly cycles
      deliverables:
        - Grant distributions
        - Progress reports

impact:
  economic: |
    Allocates 2% of treasury quarterly (~$200k at current values).
    Expected ROI through ecosystem growth and token utility.
  governance: |
    Creates new committee structure. Requires quarterly reporting
    and community oversight.
  technical: |
    Requires new smart contracts for escrow and milestone-based
    payments. Integration with existing treasury contracts.
